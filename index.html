            <h2>About Powerball</h2>
            <p>Powerball is a multi-state lottery in the United States. It is known for its large jackpots, which often reach hundreds of millions of dollars. The game is played by selecting five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from a set of 26 red Powerballs. To win the jackpot, players must match all six numbers drawn. There are also various other prize tiers for matching fewer numbers.</p>
            <p>Drawings are held multiple times a week, and tickets can be purchased in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
