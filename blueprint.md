# Powerball Lottery Drawer

## Overview

This application is a simple Powerball lottery number generator. It allows users to simulate a Powerball drawing by clicking a button, which will generate and display five random white balls and one red Powerball.

## Implemented Features

*   **UI:**
    *   A clear and simple interface with a title, a container for the lottery balls, and a "Draw" button.
    *   The lottery balls are styled to look like actual Powerball tickets.
    *   The layout is responsive and centers the content.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Clicking the "Draw Numbers" button generates 5 unique random numbers between 1 and 69 for the white balls and 1 random number between 1 and 26 for the red Powerball.
    *   The generated numbers are displayed in the UI.

## Current Plan

The current plan is to build the initial version of the Powerball Lottery Drawer as described above.
